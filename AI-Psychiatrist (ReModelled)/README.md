# AI Psychiatrist Using Langchain and LM Studio 🤖💬

This project demonstrates how to build an AI Psychiatrist using Langchain and LM Studio. The system takes user input, rephrases it to a fine-tuned prompt, and then generates a comforting response using a different language model.

## Features 🚀
- **Two Language Models:** Utilizes two different language models (`phi2` and `zephyr`) for different tasks.
- **Rephrasing Input:** The first model rephrases the input to a better understandable prompt.
- **Empathetic Responses:** The second model provides empathetic and comforting responses.
- **Memory:** Uses conversation memory to maintain context across multiple interactions.

## Benefits ✨
- **Modular Design:** Each step in the process is handled by a separate model, making it easier to manage and understand.
- **Empathy in Responses:** The AI Psychiatrist responds with empathy and offers comforting remedies.
- **Conversation Memory:** Retains conversation history to provide contextually relevant responses.

## How to Run ▶️
1. **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have Langchain and LM Studio installed.
2. **Start LM Studio:** Ensure LM Studio is running locally on `http://localhost:1234`.
3. **Run the Notebook:** Open and run the Jupyter Notebook cells in order.
4. `NOTE: Make sure you have phi-2 (by Microsoft) and StableLM Zephyr 3B (by StableLM) downloaded locally`

## Cells Breakdown 📝
The notebook is divided into cells with comments and explanations for each step.
